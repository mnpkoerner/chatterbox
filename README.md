# Chatterbox

## About

Welcome to Chatterbox. This widget is halfway between a rhyming dictionary and a thesaurus. Do you need a word that rhymes with
large and is synonymous with islands? Well, put in your query and Chatterbox will spit out a word if one exists that matches your search

If there's no words that match your search, or you'll either get back a list of synonyms or a list of other words that rhyme.

### Prerequisites
 - This project uses React, Redux, Node, and Express (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

 - This project also requires you use your own API key from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi)

### BUT WHY

I wanted to build a widget to make calls to an API. This was a super fun project to build and do some fun art to go along with it!
